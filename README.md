# Corona Overview
With this app you can view the current cases of the Coronavirus in Germany based on the dataset of the RKI (Robert Koch Institut).<br>
This app is literally faster than the [experience](https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/478220a4c454480e823b17327b2bf1d4/page/page_1/) website, because it's a native Android application which is limited to a minimum of important data.
